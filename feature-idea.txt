Fixture profiler
----------------

Three combinable modes;

1) Inline console reporting of enter/leave fixture with time elapsed. 
This is useful to correlate with other logging, e.g. from system under test

2) Aggregate report to specified filename.
Every fixture call listed with time elapsed.
Total with number of calls and total time elapsed per fixture

3) Suppress invocation of fixtures
Allows us to count the number of fixture invocations without actually running them.
This is useful because it's probably much faster than having to execute the entire suite.

The trick is that they can be used individually, or together, in any combination.
